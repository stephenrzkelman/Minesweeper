faster random library
remove all flags when opening all
possibly print twice on game end-- final state, and then solution
	maybe different type of 2nd print for win (different bomb texture?)
clear output each time
make it easier to read
	spaces instead of tabs
	separate row/column labels from grid
	add row/column labels on top & right


long-term:
figure out hints
fix/figure out better bomb ratio
guarantee good first open (no bombs neighboring)
